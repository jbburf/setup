I currently run a QNAP [TVS-882](https://www.qnap.com/en/product/tvs-882):
- Volume 1 (LUN) is 2 SSDs in a RAID1 for OS and applications.
- Volume 2 (LUN) is 6 HHDs in a RAID5 for storage.
- I installed 48GB of RAM, QNAP states this isn't supported, it is.
- I have dual M.2 SSDs installed for cache acceleration.
- This is a [useful raid utility](https://www.raid-calculator.com/default.aspx) to determine how to setup your RAID groups.

I run a [Plex Media server](https://www.plex.tv/media-server-downloads/?cat=nas&plat=qnap) and [JellyFin](https://github.com/pdulvp/jellyfin-qnap/blob/master/README.md).
- Good [list of Plex addons](https://www.reddit.com/r/PleX/comments/1bwfffx/must_have_plex_addons/?rdt=52382).

More details available about media behind Plex JellyFin by request.
