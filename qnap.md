I currently run a QNAP [TVS-882](https://www.qnap.com/en/product/tvs-882) with 6 HHDs in a RAID 5 for storage and a seperate raid 1 group of 2 SSD drives for the OS and all applications. This is a [useful raid utility](https://www.raid-calculator.com/default.aspx) to determine how to setup your RAID groups.

I run a [Plex Media server](https://www.plex.tv/media-server-downloads/?cat=nas&plat=qnap) and [JellyFin](https://github.com/pdulvp/jellyfin-qnap/blob/master/README.md).

More details available about media behind Plex JellyFin by request.
