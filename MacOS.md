## Historical
- [Luna](https://lunadisplay.com/pages/hello) was a great app that has pretty much been rendered obsolete with MacOS 10.15 and iOS 13
- [Growl](http://growl.info/downloads) was a great notification app that has been made all but obsolete by the MacOS notification center. Some people [still prefer](https://computers.tutsplus.com/tutorials/quick-tip-growl-vs-notification-center--mac-45845) Growl over the notification center, I've switched away from it.
- [TotalFinder](https://totalfinder.binaryage.com/) was a great little app that provide a much better terminal visor than iTerm2. Unfortunately it died with SIP in MacOS Mojave.
- [F.lux](https://justgetflux.com/) has been great for years but Apple has finally copied its functionality with Night Shift and so I have moved to using the native solution instead of using this app (though I like it better).
