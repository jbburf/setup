# setup
Description of my current (and historical) computer setup.

I prefer to run [MacOS](/MacOS.md) and [iOS](/iOS.md) on my mobile devices. I run [Windows 10](/Windows10.md) and linux in a VM.

For [Javascipt](/javascript.md) based development I prefer VS Code and the zsh shell. Here is the best [shell info](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/OpenSource/Conceptual/ShellScripting/Introduction/Introduction.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40004268-TP40003516-SW1) I have found.
