# setup
Description of my current (and historical) computer setup.

I prefer to run [MacOS](/MacOS.md) and [iOS](/iOS.md) on my mobile devices. I run [Windows](/Windows.md) and linux in a VM (if I have to).

To learn more about modifying Apple hardware read this excellent write up of the [Mac Pro (2019)](https://blog.greggant.com/posts/2021/12/19/definitive-mac-pro-2019-upgrade-guide.html), [Mac Pro (trash can)](https://blog.greggant.com/posts/2019/05/07/the-definitive-mac-pro-2013-trashcan-guide.html) and [Mac Pro (2013)](https://github.com/ameyrupji/macpro-5-1/blob/master/README.md).

Languade / stack specific:

* For [Javascipt](/javascript.md) based development I prefer VS Code and the zsh shell. Here is the best [shell info](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/OpenSource/Conceptual/ShellScripting/Introduction/Introduction.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40004268-TP40003516-SW1) I have found.
* Scripting windows boxes with [PowerShell](/powershell.md).

Understanding the [OSI 7 layer network model](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/osi-model-networking-layers-explained-in-plain-english/) and [subnetting](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/subnet-cheat-sheet-24-subnet-mask-30-26-27-29-and-other-ip-address-cidr-network-references/).

Cloud learning and [AI](/ai.md). There's a great grouping of info about [AWS's SA cert here](https://github.com/keenanromain/AWS-SAA-C02-Study-Guide).

Information about my current [QNAP home server](/qnap.md).
