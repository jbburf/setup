## Crypto Mining on Ubuntu VMs

Using [xmrig](https://xmrig.com/docs/miner/build/ubuntu) to mine [Monero](https://minexmr.com/miningguide) on Ubunto 20.04 VMs (good [installation guide](https://vpsfix.com/16046/install-xmrig-cpu-miner-on-ubuntu-20-04-with-cli/)).
- Going to move to [xmr-node-proxy](https://github.com/Snipa22/xmr-node-proxy) to run multiple pools.

Will be spinning up [Quantum](https://www.theqrl.org) with a few VMs to test performance of CPU mining compared to Monero.

Using the [Monero Wallet](https://www.getmonero.org/downloads/#gui) with seperate wallets for each VM/pool group.

So far I've been using [XMR](https://pools.xmr.wiki/) [pools](https://www.investopedia.com/tech/how-do-mining-pools-work/) and [WollyPolly polls](https://woolypooly.com/en/) to mine Monero. I plan to setup solo mining / transactions outside of a pool in the near future.
